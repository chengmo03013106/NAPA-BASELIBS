   @section intro Introduction

   The GRAPES prototype code is the reference implementation for the evolving GRAPES (aka. PULSE+) API.
   The main point is to demonstrate the intended final <b>structure</b> of the implementation, with
   omitting as much details as possible. Thus, the pre-prototype contains C language bindings for
   most of the datatypes, API calls etc. without the actual implementation, or with a <i>stub</i>
   implementation only for internal testing and to demonstrate the intended structure.

   Thus, most of the information found in this documentation is intended for GRAPES developers.

   @section structure Code Structure

   Each module (listed below) is separated into a sub-directory within the source tree.
   The public interfaces (APIs) are located in the <i>include/</i> sub-directory in the 
   correspondingly named .h file (e.g. ml.h for the Messaging Layer which resides in sub-directory <i>ml/</i>
   Module subdirectories are as follows:
	- ml/ - <b>Messaging Layer</b> - ml.h
	- mon/ - <b>Monitoring Layer</b> - mon.h
	- rep/ - <b>Repository</b> - repoclient.h
	- som/ - <b>Scheduler and Overlay Manager</b> - som.h
	- ul/ - <b>User</b> (interface) <b>Layer</b> - ul.h

   @section deps Dependencies

   The pre-prototype code uses a number of external open-source libraries.
   Most importantly, the <A HREF="http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/">libevent</A> framework 
   is used to implement the reactive architecture, which was chosen as the 
   model of computation for GRAPES.
   Additionally, further open-source libraries are used to perform common tasks
   such as config file parsing and logging.
   
   Included libraries are:
	- <A HREF="http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/">libevent</A>: event loop library to implement 
	the reactive architecture
	- <A HREF="http://www.nongnu.org/confuse/">libconfuse</A>: configuration file parsing library
	- <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dclog/">dclog</A>: log message writer library
