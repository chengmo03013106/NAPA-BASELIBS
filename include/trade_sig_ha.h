 * @brief Chunk Signaling API - Higher Abstraction (HA).
 *
 * The trade signaling HA provides a set of primitives for chunks signaling negotiation with other peers, in order to collect information for the effective chunk exchange with other peers. <br>
 * This is a part of the Data Exchange Protocol which provides high level abstraction for chunks' negotiations, like requesting and proposing chunks.
