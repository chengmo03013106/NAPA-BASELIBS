 * @brief This file contains a udp socket abstraction. 
 *
 * The udpSocket is in the current implementation an abstraction for the linux operating system and developed with ubuntu version 8.04. Should it be neccassy to run the messaging layer under another OS the udpSocket would have to be replaced by an implementation for that operating system.
